# Agile Audit Extension

Audit Extension provides a mechanism to store all changes that happen during persistance of your model. This extension is designed to be extensive and flexible. Use Audit if you need to track changes performed by your users in great detail.

Audit supports a wide varietty of additional features such as ability to **undo** actions, record actions that have **failed** to execute (due to validation) along with the error, **retry** failed actions, retrieve **historical** records without modifying database, log **custom** actions and even **replay** all actions. Audit also records which **field values** were changed inside a model before executing `save()` and which fields were changed **reactively** (through other hooks) and will track and link reactive modifications to **multiple models**.

Huge focus on extensibility allow you to **customise** name of log table, change field names, database **engine** (e.g. store in CSV file, API or Cloud Database), **switch off** certain features, customise **human-readable** log entries and add additional information about **user**, **session** or **environment**.

## Enabling Audit Log

To enable extension for your model, add the following line into Model's method `init`:

``` php
$this->add(new \Atk4\Audit\Controller());
```

For a basic usage you will also need to create `audit_log` table by importing `audit_log.sql` file. The audit-log is automatically populated when you perform an operation with the model next time:

``` php
$m->load(1);
$m['name'] = 'Ken'; // was Vinny before
$m->save();
```

The following new record will be stored inside `audit_log` table:

``` json
{
   "id":1,
   "initiator_audit_log_id":null,
   "ts":{
      "date":"2016-10-03 21:44:14.000000",
      "timezone_type":3,
      "timezone":"UTC"
   },
   "model":"Atk4\\Ui\\Tests\\AuditableUser",
   "model_id":"1",
   "action":"update",
   "time_taken":0.00174,
   "descr":"update name=Ken",
   "user_info":null,
   "request_diff":{
      "name":[
         "Vinny",
         "Ken"
      ]
   },
   "reactive_diff":null,
   "is_reverted":null,
   "revert_audit_log_id":null
}
```

-   [Custom event logging and customizing](custom.md)
-   [Various storage options](storage.md)

## Working With the Log Entries

Your model contains reference to AuditLog model. Let's see how many times the above record have been modified in the past:

``` php
echo $m->load(1)->ref('AuditLog')->action('count')->getOne();  // 1
```

You can also use it to access records individually or just access last record:

``` php
$m->load(1)->ref('AuditLog')->loadLast()->undo(); // revert last action
```

If you wish to undo all the actions for specific record, run:

```php
$yesterday = new DateTime();
$yesterday->sub(new DateInterval('P1D'));

$m->load(1)->ref('AuditLog')
    ->addCondition('date', '>=', $yesterday)
    ->addCondition('is_reverted')
    ->each('undo');
    // revert all actions, that have happened today
    // but exclude those that have been reverted already
```

## Requested and Reactive field changes

AuditLog extension records fields that were `dirty` before execution of save() operation. Sometimes you would have a logic inside your model hooks that can change more records or even change other models. For example if you change `InvoiceLine` amount it might want to update amount of `Inovice` too.



## Requested vs Reactive actions

Agile Data incorporates rich volume of logic that allow you to make a lot of decision across the system when even a smallest change is requested. For example assuming you have the following structure:

-   Invoice
    -   `addFields(['total_net', 'total_vat', 'total_gross'], ['type' => 'money']);`
    -   `hasMany('Line')`
        -   `addField('qty', ['type => 'int'])`
        -   `addField('vat_rate', ['type' => 'float'])`
        -   `addFields(['price', 'vat', 'net', 'gross'], ['type' => 'money']);`

Your `afterSave` hooks will automatically recalculate and update `Invoice` whenever you change the `Line`. Additionally, changing `qty` will trigger change in `vat`, `net` and `gross`.

Looking at he following code:

``` php
$m = new Invoice($db);
$m->load(1);
$m['qty']++;
$m->save();
```

Only a single field falls into "requested" change, which is `qty`. The original value and a new value will be stored in JSON:

``` json
{"qty": [5, 6]}
```

However due to hooks, many other values have also been updated. For the Line the "reactive" changes are:

``` json
{"net": [50, 60], "vat": [11.5, 13.8], "gross": [51.5, 63.8]}
```

Then you have some "reactive" changes for the `Invoice` model too:

``` php
{"total_net": [100, 110], "total_vat": [23.0, 25.3], "total_gross": [123.0, 135.3]}
```

The default way for Audit Log is to store only "reactive" changes, however you can enable storing of both "requested" and "reactivte":

``` php
$audit = new \Atk4\Audit\Controller([
    new Audit(),
    ['requested_log' => true, 'reactive_log' => true, 'link' => true]
);
```

The option for `nested` will also associate changes inside `Invoice` with the requested changes of `Line`. If you need to customise settings on per-model basis, you should create individual controllers.

## How values are stored?

Audit Extension uses array persistence to prepare values for storage inside JSON. If you need to tweak how values are stored exactly, you shourd refer to documentation on [typecasting](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/persistence.html?highlight=typecasting#type-converting).

System is storing using business-domain field names. If "net" has an actual field of "sql_net", then audit will store "net". Additionally

## Undo and Replay features

Agile Audit Extension perform a strict type auditing which can be quite useful for automation. Certain actions can be "undone" or "replayed" (Redo).

Those action can be performed on the `Audit` model after you load the record:

``` php
$audit->load(20);
$audit->replay();
```

Assuming that audit log with ID=20 corresponds to the `qty` modifications as I was explaining above, the replay will perform the following:

-   start transaction
-   load model for `Line`
-   perform modification of `qty`
-   save value of `qty`
-   track changed fields in `Line` and `Invoice`
-   assert to make sure all the same reactive changes happened
-   commit

Similarly you can also call `undo()`, which will:

-   Reverse all `new` / `old` values for original Audit event and all related ones
-   Attempts to apply the replay()

Both `Undo` and `Replay` functionality can bypass the verification steps or can actually enforce `Reactive` changes to be used. Those modes are less safe but if that's what you want you can try it.

Finally, Replay feature can also override `id` of the original model. In this scenario changes will be re-applied to a different record.

### When Undo and Replay are useful?

Undo can be offered to a user as an option. Because implementation of `Undo` especially in transaction-supporting database is pretty safe, you can execute multiple `Undo` actions effectively allowing you to walk between revisions of your persistence.

``` php
$audit = new Audit($db);
$audit->addCondition('user_id', $this->app->user->id);
$audit->addCondition('date', '>', $unroll_to_date);
$audit->setOrder('id desc');
$audit->each('undo');
```

Applying `Replay` on the range of entries makes a pretty effective multi-record update technique.

```php
$invoices = $client->ref('Invoice'); // references multiple invoices
$invoices->add($audit);

// record action
$invoices->loadAny();
$invoices->save( $new_data );

$audit->last_action->applyOnOthers($invoices);
```

Finally, replay can be used in creating unit tests. If you have enabled Audit Log for your application and have already performed some actions, you can generate  `PHPUnit`-compatible code through Admin Audit Page.

## Admin Page

Audit Extension comes with [Agile UI](https://github.com/atk4/ui) based page that contains a handy management console where you can browse all the recent events, convert them into unit-tests, undo or re-apply some of those. Additionally selecting an event will also show you all the "Reactive" actions that have been done.
